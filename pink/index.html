		<p>In a blog post, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Krulwich" target="blank">Robert Krulwich</a> of the public radio show <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiolab" target="blank">Radiolab</a> pointed out that the rainbow's hues do not include pink.</p>
		<p>Remember the ROYGBIV mnemonic for the rainbow colors? The R(red) is the furthest thing from V(violet). That is the source of the problem. Pink can't exist in nature without a little rainbow-bending magic, which allows red and violet tones to mix. This has led experts to assume that “pink is a made-up color,” as Krulwich puts it. </p>
		<p>That's all there is to it. Pink, the hue, is simply our brain's wishful thinking combining red and violet wavelengths to form the color of many little girls' birthday celebrations. </p>
